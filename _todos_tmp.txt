Risk/reward Ratio

For the Risk/reward Ration, calculated in the Risk assessment of the stock Research part of the tool, I think the wrong target Price is sued. Please make sure to use the Target Price shown in the Quick metrics instead of the one displayed in the Risk assessment. Please make sure to doulble check if that makes sense. Then recalculate the Risk reward Ratio based on the new target Price. Make sure to know where the target Price in the quick metrics is coming from and why this value was not initially used. If you think the target Price newds to be changed after confirming, please update the calculation of the Risk reward value.
