Overview
Can you add an overview tab that should Show which data from which tab is pulled from which data source. Please make sure to make this intuitiv to view for the end user. It should be very clear which data is linked to which data source. There should also be the possibility to see alternative data Sources, if the main data source is not available and when this is triggered or if there is no alternative.
I will add more data Sources in the future and I Need a good view on this to know which data is handled by which source. All data Sources not available at the Moment should be marked and a short description on why the source is not available should be included.
Please make sure to analyse the structure of the tool and the different data Sources before you begin implementing anything. It is crucial to understand the structure in Depth.
Please try to make this very graphical to get a good overview very fast. 



Proxy:
I found a Proxy tool here: https://github.com/bluet/proxybroker2
Can you please include this Proxy tool into the tool to use a Proxy for specific data Sources. These data Sources should be configurable via the Configuration tab.
For the configured data Sources all requests should be handeld via the Proxy tool. At start up a heralth check should be done to see if the Proxy tool is working. This tool should also be displayed in the Dashboard at the top with the other data Sources and a green indication if working.
The Proxy tool should be run as docker (see Website for more Information: https://github.com/bluet/proxybroker2). Use playwright-mcp to read the Website. This will also give you infromation on how to install and use the tool.
