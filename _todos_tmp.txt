The follwoing functions should be implemented or added to existing functions:

1. Multi-Timeframe Strategy for Signal Robustness:
The tool should analyze data across three distinct time horizons tailored to the intended strategy (e.g., swing trading):

Primary Trend (Context): The longest timeframe (Daily charts) is used to define the overall market trend, often confirmed by the 200-period EMA. This determines the overall bias (long or short).   

Confirmation (Signal Validation): An intermediate timeframe (60-minute charts) is used to confirm that the local trade setup aligns with the dominant primary trend.   

Execution (Entry Refinement): The shortest timeframe (5-minute charts) is used to pinpoint precise entry and exit points, leveraging volatility and momentum indicators.   


2. Contextual Risk Assessment (Beta)
To assess the stock's systematic risk within the broader market context, the tool should calculate the stock's Beta relative to a benchmark index (NASDAQ). A Beta greater than 1 suggests the stock is more volatile than the market, while a Beta less than 1 suggests lower volatility. This metric informs the final recommendation's risk profile.   


3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Interpretation and Conditional Weighting: 
 - Overbought:RSI > 70 suggests the asset price may have risen too quickly, signaling a potential reversal.
 - Oversold: RSI < 30 suggests the asset price may have dropped too far, signaling a likely bounce.
The tool must apply conditional weighting to RSI signals. If the long-term trend (e.g., 200-EMA) is strongly bullish, an RSI reading above 70 should not automatically generate a "Strong Sell" signal, as assets in robust trends can remain overbought for extended periods.28 Instead, the TAA assigns a reduced or neutral weight to the "overbought" condition in a strong uptrend environment, preventing premature exit and ensuring that short-term momentum signals do not override the dominant trend context.

Can you also add a small graph to the RSI Card to better visualize the values. But Keep also the existing visualization as is.



3. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation Filtering (MFTA Multiplier)
Reliable trading signals must be confirmed across different timeframes. The tool should use a rigorous Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MFTA) confirmation mechanism that modifies the final WTS score.   

The decision-making process includes an MFTA Alignment Rule: if the short-term entry signal aligns with the long-term primary trend context (e.g., bullish crossover on 60-minute confirmed by price above 200-EMA on the Daily chart), the TAA applies a positive WTS Multiplier (e.g., 1.2x) to amplify the final score. Conversely, if the execution signal contradicts the primary trend, a penalizing multiplier (e.g., 0.5x) is applied, actively dampening the signal’s confidence and generally preventing trades against the dominant direction. 


Can you please now add another Agent to the tool. It will be the Risk assessment and result Agent. This Agent must take all the provided data from the stock Research and  analyse all the results from the different Cards to get a view on an Investment decision and the Risk we would face when buying at the current Price. 
Please make sure to first make an overview of the available metrics from the stock Research and the results provided from this stock Research part on the different Topics. Please understand the structure of the tol to include this Agent in the best way. This Agent should be run after the stock Research and the Underlying Analysis has finished. 
Use the following files from the Project folder as a starting Point to develop this Agent: 
- scoring agent draft.md
- scoring values.json

Be sure to plan the implementation in Detail before starting to code.
The UI displaying the results should Change as follows:
1. Keep the Chart at the top with all Information in it.
2. The results of the Agent should be displayed below the graph.
2.1 A high Level summary of the most important results should be displayd in card. The detailed results should be hidden.
2.2 If the users wants to see all Details of the results there should be the possibility to Show the results with a toogle button.
2. The rest of the results from the stock Research and the first Analysis should be hidden in a toggle filed that can be expanded if needed by the user.
When a new Research is started all Cards should be collapsed.


UI redo:
Can you please review the complete stock Research UI part of the tool. The provided data all look promising and the Overall style is nice. I would like to make a complete review of the way the data is displayed in the UI, as this is not very user friendly and it is hard to get a good overview of all data and to understand the Underlying decisions the tool makes on wheter to invest in the stock or not. Can you please first get a good overview of the UI and how this is presented to the user and then thjink of the best way on how to present this to the user. The way each bit of data is presented in the UI components is very nice, but how the data is placed and ordered to form a complete Picture of the data is not perfect. 

Style:
Please make sure to use the Image Website-style-example.jpg as Inspiration for the design of the Website. This example is from a different sector, but we are only interested in the Styling and layout of this page. Make sure to first analyse this example and extract the relevant Fonts, layout ideas, Colors, sylings and further concepts that are important. Put this into a style guide file that will make and use it throughout the Project to have a similar look for all pages. Please make sure that it will be easy to later make changes to the look, like changing Colors or the font.

For all changes please Keep in mind that it is important to present the Information to the user in the best way to make it easy for him to understand the presented data. 





Very good! Can you make the following changes:
1. In the Investment Decision part at the top the Risk assessment result says "High Risk" and a score of 15 - all marked in red Color. In the Details part further dwon on the page the Risk assessment does not Mention "High Risk" the score of 15 and it is not marked in red with the decision sell. Make sure the detailed part is consistent with the top part.
2. In the toggle bar for Growth Analysis the Color indicates a hold Position and it displayes the score. For the toggle bar of the Technical Indicators says Neutral. All toggle bars should be consitent in the naming convention. This should be only SELL, HOLD, BUY with the relevant Color coding. Make sure the toggle bar only Shows These decisions in the reelvant Color. The scores should be inside when you expand the field.
3. In the Key Takeaways part the first text field is cut off after some words. Pelase make sure to present the full text or make it able to expand by clicking. 
4. The Key Takeaways part suggest a Hold (example for TSLA) but the Investment Decision part suggest a sell. This must be consitent and must be based on the Underlying data.


The provided results for calculation of the entry Point and the decision based on the support and resistance lines are not correct in my opinion. I Need to know 2 Things here: 
1. Would the current Price be a good entry Point
2. What would be a good entry Point.
To make These decisions you Need to analyse all prepared support and resistance lines near the current Price or the entry Level that is suggested and make a decsision based on These Levels and the rest of the technical Analysis. To give you an idea on how to best calculate this, please see file "tech-analysis-logic-update.md" in the Project folder. Use this file to update the current logic where needed. Make sure to first understand how it is currenty perfomred, which data is used and hwat logic is used. Then use the Knowledge from the file to update where necessary or rebuild parts of it, if needed.
MAke sure to include a Risk and Reward calculation when deciding on a entry Point.



Very good!
For the Price Targets in the Growth Stock Analysis part, can you please add values for the missing Price Targets? If this data is not available you can you one Approach mentioned in Future_value.jpg. Make sure to first understand These approaches and then validate them in a Research. If they fit to the Approach of the tool and the available data, then please inclide These calculations to the tool and fill the missing values. Please review this part of the Analysis part to make sure the new values are considered in the Overall Analysis process.
Please first understand this part of the code to best include the new values if relevant.


Ticker Symbols and lnks
In the Fund Tracker part of the Website, can you please add the stock ticker to the stocks. You don't Need to Show this ticker, but Keep it with the stocks. This infromation will be needed in the next step.
Please make the displayed stocks in the tabs: Holdings, Recent Changes, New Positions and Sold Positions, clickable.
If a user clicks on one stock, this stock should be added to a selection of ticker Symbols (only the ticker Symbols are needed). A second click on the stock should de-select the stock.
The selection should Display only the ticker Symbols in a seperate element of the page. This element should be invisible, if no stock is selected. If one or more stocks are selected, there should also be a button "Analyse". When clicked These stocks should be sent to the Stock Research tab and a Research for all selected ticker shouold be started. It is important that the ticker Symbols are passed as Argument, because that is what this function is expecting. If a stock is not found, it should be skipped an an error should be displayed to the user.
The element with the ticker Symbols should be very compact and modern Looking.
Please make sure to fully understand the current tool and the function, before planning this new feature. It should  blend seamlessly in the tool.
