Overview
Can you add an overview tab that should Show which data from which tab is pulled from which data source. Please make sure to make this intuitiv to view for the end user. It should be very clear which data is linked to which data source. There should also be the possibility to see alternative data Sources, if the main data source is not available and when this is triggered or if there is no alternative.
I will add more data Sources in the future and I Need a good view on this to know which data is handled by which source. All data Sources not available at the Moment should be marked and a short description on why the source is not available should be included.
Please make sure to analyse the structure of the tool and the different data Sources before you begin implementing anything. It is crucial to understand the structure in Depth.
Please try to make this very graphical to get a good overview very fast. 



Proxy:
I found a Proxy tool here: https://github.com/bluet/proxybroker2
Can you please include this Proxy tool into the tool to use a Proxy for specific data Sources. These data Sources should be configurable via the Configuration tab.
For the configured data Sources all requests should be handeld via the Proxy tool. At start up a heralth check should be done to see if the Proxy tool is working. This tool should also be displayed in the Dashboard at the top with the other data Sources and a green indication if working.
The Proxy tool should be run as docker (see Website for more Information: https://github.com/bluet/proxybroker2). Use playwright-mcp to read the Website. This will also give you infromation on how to install and use the tool.
Please make as few changes as possible to the current tool. Make sure to analyse the structure of the tool first to find the best way to include the Proxy tool.
Please think Deep before starting to implement.

If no data souorce is configured to use the Proxy Server, the Proxy Server should not be started. Only if the user activates a data source to use the Proxy, the Proxy Server should be started.

Can you add to the Fund TRacker tab a refresh button that will trigger a check on all funds to load the newest data (Holdings, changes, sells, buys) to the relevant tabs. 


Scrpaer
In the tool a scraping Agent should be implemented to scrape data from different webistes. Can you please review the tool to identify where this scraper is used and for what.
I noticed that when I add a Website it does not Show up on the drop down in the Configuration tab in the field to select a Website. Can you make sure this data is saved properly.

Configuration tab:
In the Configuration tab there is a section for adding Websites that will be scraped and the data used in the tool. In this section it would e necessary to have more Inputs when adding a Website:
New Website to scrpae from:
- Website URL (already there),
- Scraping model (already there) -> this will be sued for all Websites, so seperate this setting,
- Analysis model (already there) -> this will be sued for all Websites, so seperate this setting,
- a descritpion of what data should be scraped,
- a Dropdown of possible functions/agents that can use this data (Dashboard Sentiment, hot stocks, hot sectors, bad sectors,analyst Ratings, News, ETF Holdings, ETF Holding changes, Fund Holdings,Fund Holding changes).
- a Name for the data source.
Please make sure to adapt the Configuration Website according to the new data above and the table in the database where the Websites are saved and all functions related to this (correct Arguments, fomrats, etc.).

When adding a new Website the tool should make an initial test to see if data can be scraped and if the data is correct and what the user is Looking for. So this test should return to the user the scraped data and then the user can deciode to modify the descritpion of that is scraped or cancel the process. There should also be an Option for existing Websites to check the scrpaing process by the user and see what the scraper Returns. The Agent must make sure the Format fits the fucntions using this data.There should be templates to use for all Kinds of data (Dashboard Sentiment, hot stocks, hot sectors, bad sectors,analyst Ratings, News, ETF Holdings, ETF Holding changes, Fund Holdings,Fund Holding changes).
When added this will be a new data source that can be used in the tool and will be configured in the Overview tab (see below).

Overview tab:
In the Overview tab, I don't see the scraper function being used for any data. In this Overview tab it should be possible to make changes to the data source used. The user should be able to switch to a different data source. Make sure to save all changes to the data source i the Database. Make sure that all changes in data source will work (correct data, correct Format, number of Arguments, etc). This sholud be kept in mind when implementing templates for the new categories of data Sources (Dashboard Sentiment, hot stocks, hot sectors, bad sectors,analyst Ratings, News, ETF Holdings, ETF Holding changes, Fund Holdings,Fund Holding changes).

Add data source
Can you add a section on the Dashboard that Shows the top gainer and top loser stocks. The data should be taken from an available API (Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage) if this data is available there. There should also be the possibility to load this data from a different source (web scraped data). To configure this I want to be able to configure the data source or multiple data Sources for the Top Gainer and Top Loser. The user should be able to select one or more data Sources for this and an Agent should be in charge of merging These into one data set. Please make sure that wehn I add a new web scraping Website that this will be added as new data source and I can select this. There will be more categories like Top Gainer or Top Loser in the future, so make this very fexible to add more categories. 
In the Overview tab I want to be able to select which data Sources are used for what. In the Dashboard section of the Overview tab there is a category of data called "Web Scraped Market Data" which has the data source Web Scraping. This should be more explicit: 
- for the Dashboard there is News data scraped from Yahoo,
- Market Sentiment from Yahoo,...
Please make sure to understand the structure fully before you implement any Changs.


In the Dashboard tab I noticed that the data from the webscraped Websites is used not correctly. The idea is that I extract different categores of data from different wesites. This data should then flow into the Dashboard under the reelvant category. If there are multipole Sources for one category the data should be combined. Currently it Looks like if I select for example the top Gainer data source it retrieves all scraped data. I want from the Top Gainer data source only a list of top gainer stocks. Please make also sure to check if the scraping of the Website is implemented correctly. For Top Gainer and Top Loser stocks I want to get a list of stocks with a percentage on how much they moved the day before. Please make sure to understand the structure fully before you implement any Changs.


Valuation
For the stock Research  want to update the calculation of the fair value of the Company. This new Information must be included in the Overall Analysis of the stock. Please make sure to analyse the current process for the valuation and implement this new feature in the best way. The new valuation process can distinquish between different Kind of comnpanies and Chose the best Approach to calculate the value (see Details below).
After implementing, please make sure to rebuild all necessary parts of the tool and test this in Depth to verify the correct functioning.

Process for Evaluation:
# Complete Guide to Company Valuation Methods and Intrinsic Value Formulas

Determining what a company is truly worth requires selecting the right valuation methodology for each unique situation. **No single approach works universally**—a profitable dividend-paying utility demands different methods than a cash-burning SaaS startup. This guide provides complete mathematical formulas for every major valuation technique, practical guidance on implementation using publicly available data, and a decision framework to match methods with company characteristics.

The fundamental insight is that valuation is both science and art: formulas provide structure, but judgment determines inputs. Master the mechanics first, then develop intuition for when each tool applies.

---

## Discounted Cash Flow models remain the theoretical gold standard

DCF analysis projects future cash flows and discounts them to present value using an appropriate rate of return. The approach captures intrinsic value based on fundamentals rather than market sentiment—making it essential for serious equity analysis.

### Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) captures enterprise value

FCFF represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) after operating expenses and reinvestment.

**Primary Formula:**
```
FCFF = EBIT × (1 - t) + D&A - CapEx - ΔWC
```

**Alternative formulations:**
```
FCFF = Net Income + D&A + Interest × (1 - t) - CapEx - ΔWC
FCFF = CFO + Interest × (1 - t) - CapEx
```

**Variable definitions:**
- **EBIT** = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (from income statement)
- **t** = Corporate tax rate (find in 10-K tax footnote)
- **D&A** = Depreciation & Amortization (cash flow statement)
- **CapEx** = Capital Expenditures (investing section of cash flow statement)
- **ΔWC** = Change in Net Working Capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding cash)

**Enterprise Value calculation:**
```
Enterprise Value = Σ [FCFFₜ / (1 + WACC)ᵗ] + Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)ⁿ
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
```

**When to use FCFF:** Companies with changing capital structure, negative FCFE but positive FCFF, leveraged buyout analysis, or when valuing entire business units. FCFF excels for capital-intensive industries reducing debt.

### Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) values equity directly

FCFE measures cash available to common shareholders after debt payments and reinvestment.

**Formula:**
```
FCFE = Net Income + D&A - CapEx - ΔWC + Net Borrowing
```

**Direct equity valuation:**
```
Equity Value = Σ [FCFEₜ / (1 + re)ᵗ] + Terminal Value / (1 + re)ⁿ
```

Where **re** = cost of equity (calculated via CAPM). Use FCFE when capital structure is stable and you're valuing from the equity holder's perspective.

### Dividend Discount Models work for mature dividend payers

**Gordon Growth Model (single-stage):**
```
P₀ = D₁ / (re - g) = D₀ × (1 + g) / (re - g)
```

**Two-Stage DDM:**
```
P₀ = Σ [D₀ × (1 + gₛ)ᵗ / (1 + re)ᵗ] + [Dₙ × (1 + g∞) / (re - g∞)] × [1 / (1 + re)ⁿ]
```

**H-Model (linearly declining growth):**
```
V₀ = D₀ × [(1 + gL) + H × (gS - gL)] / (re - gL)
```

Where **H** = half-life of high-growth period, **gS** = initial supernormal growth, **gL** = long-term stable growth. The H-Model captures gradual growth deceleration more realistically than abrupt two-stage transitions.

**Constraints:** Growth rate (g) must be less than the required return (re), and terminal growth should not exceed long-term nominal GDP growth (**2-3% for developed markets**).

### Adjusted Present Value separates financing effects

APV explicitly values the tax benefits of debt separately from operating value—essential when leverage changes over time.

**Formula:**
```
APV = NPV(Unlevered Firm) + PV(Interest Tax Shields) - PV(Financial Distress Costs)
```

**Components:**
```
Unlevered Value = Σ [FCFₜ / (1 + rU)ᵗ]  (discount at unlevered cost of equity)
Tax Shield = Σ [Interest × Tax Rate / (1 + rd)ᵗ]
```

**When to use APV:** LBOs with aggressive debt paydown, project finance with specific debt schedules, subsidized financing, or when tax shields are uncertain (loss carryforwards).

---

## Relative valuation provides market-based benchmarks

Multiples-based valuation anchors value to how the market prices comparable companies. While less theoretically pure than DCF, relative valuation reflects real market pricing and highlights over/undervaluation versus peers.

### Price-to-Earnings captures profit expectations

**Basic formulas:**
```
Trailing P/E = Current Price / LTM EPS
Forward P/E = Current Price / Next 12 Months EPS (consensus estimate)
```

**Justified P/E (from fundamentals):**
```
P/E = (1 - b) / (re - g)
```

Where **(1-b)** = dividend payout ratio, **re** = required return, **g** = growth rate. A company with 60% payout, 10% required return, and 3% growth has a justified P/E of **8.6x**.

**PEG Ratio normalizes for growth:**
```
PEG = P/E Ratio / Expected EPS Growth Rate (as whole number)
```

A PEG of **1.0** suggests fair value relative to growth; below 1.0 may indicate undervaluation. However, PEG breaks down for low-growth companies.

### Price-to-Book anchors value to net assets

```
P/B = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
Book Value per Share = (Shareholders' Equity - Preferred Stock) / Shares Outstanding
```

**Justified P/B:**
```
P/B = (ROE - g) / (re - g)
```

If ROE exceeds the required return, the company deserves a premium to book value. **P/B is most useful for financial institutions** (banks, insurers) where book value approximates market value of assets, and for asset-heavy industries approaching liquidation scenarios.

### Enterprise Value multiples enable capital structure-neutral comparison

**Enterprise Value:**
```
EV = Market Cap + Total Debt + Preferred + Minority Interest - Cash
```

**EV/EBITDA (most common):**
```
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / (EBIT + D&A)
```

**Typical ranges:** Public companies average **~8x**; private transactions **4-6x**; high-growth tech **15-30x+**.

**EV/Revenue (for unprofitable companies):**
```
EV/Revenue = Enterprise Value / Total Revenue
```

Use EV/Revenue when EBITDA is negative. Tech/SaaS companies often trade at **5-15x revenue**; traditional industries **1-2x**.

### Comparable company analysis requires disciplined peer selection

**Step-by-step methodology:**

1. **Select peers** using same industry (SIC/GICS), similar size (market cap within 0.5x-2x), comparable growth rates, and similar business models. Sources: 10-K competition section, proxy statement compensation peers.

2. **Gather data** for each peer: share price, debt, cash, revenue, EBITDA, earnings, book value. Calendarize financials if fiscal years differ.

3. **Calculate multiples** for each peer: trailing and forward EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/Revenue.

4. **Use median** (not mean) to reduce outlier impact. Calculate 25th and 75th percentiles for range.

5. **Apply to target:**
```
Implied Value = Target Metric × Selected Multiple
```

### Precedent transactions include control premiums

Analyze prices paid in historical M&A transactions for similar companies.

**Control Premium:**
```
Premium (%) = (Offer Price / Unaffected Price - 1) × 100
```

Unaffected price = stock price before deal announcement (typically 1-30 days prior). **Typical control premiums: 20-40%** over market price.

**Data sources:** SEC merger proxies (DEF 14A), 8-K filings, SDC Platinum, Bloomberg M&A database, PitchBook.

---

## Asset-based methods establish floor values

Asset-based valuation anchors value to what a company owns rather than what it earns—essential for distressed situations, holding companies, and asset-intensive businesses.

### Book value provides starting point

```
Equity Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
Book Value per Share = (Shareholders' Equity - Preferred) / Shares Outstanding
```

**Adjusted book value** marks assets to fair market value rather than historical cost. Key adjustments include real estate appraisals, LIFO-to-FIFO inventory conversion, and removal of impaired intangibles.

### Liquidation value sets absolute floor

```
Liquidation Value = Σ (Asset × Recovery Rate) - Total Liabilities - Liquidation Costs
```

**Typical recovery rates:**
| Asset Type | Orderly Liquidation | Forced Sale |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Cash | 100% | 100% |
| Marketable Securities | 95-100% | 90-100% |
| Accounts Receivable | 70-90% | 50-80% |
| Inventory | 50-75% | 25-50% |
| PP&E | 50-80% | 20-50% |
| Goodwill/Intangibles | 0-20% | 0% |

Ben Graham's Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) strategy—buying stocks trading below liquidation value—historically generated excess returns.

### NAV for REITs uses cap rates

```
Property Value = Net Operating Income / Capitalization Rate
REIT NAV = FMV of Properties + Cash + Other Assets - Debt - Overhead (capitalized)
NAV per Share = NAV / Shares Outstanding
```

Compare market price to NAV to identify premium/discount. REITs trading at significant discounts to NAV may be undervalued.

---

## Residual Income and EVA measure economic profit

These methods value companies based on their ability to generate returns above the cost of capital—particularly useful for financial institutions and companies with unpredictable cash flows.

### Residual Income Model values abnormal earnings

**Residual Income calculation:**
```
RI = Net Income - (re × Book Value)
RI = (ROE - re) × Book Value
```

**Valuation formula:**
```
V₀ = BV₀ + Σ [RIₜ / (1 + re)ᵗ]
```

A company creates value only when ROE exceeds the cost of equity. The model explicitly quantifies this value creation.

### Economic Value Added (EVA) measures operational value creation

**Core formula:**
```
EVA = NOPAT - (WACC × Invested Capital)
EVA = (ROIC - WACC) × Invested Capital
```

**NOPAT calculation:**
```
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
```

**Invested Capital:**
```
Invested Capital = Net Working Capital + Net PP&E + Goodwill + Other Operating Assets
```

Or equivalently:
```
Invested Capital = Total Debt + Equity - Excess Cash - Non-operating Assets
```

**Common adjustments:** Capitalize R&D (typically 3-7 year amortization), capitalize operating leases, adjust LIFO reserves to FIFO, add back goodwill impairments.

**Market Value Added connects EVA to market value:**
```
MVA = Market Value of Equity - Book Value of Equity = PV of all future EVAs
```

### Sum-of-the-parts values diversified businesses

For conglomerates, value each business segment separately using the most appropriate method, then sum.

```
SOTP Value = Σ (Segment EV) - Corporate Overhead (capitalized) - Net Debt + Non-operating Assets
```

**Implementation:**
1. Identify segments from 10-K segment disclosures (required under ASC 280)
2. Select appropriate valuation method per segment (EV/EBITDA for mature, EV/Revenue for growth)
3. Apply peer multiples to each segment's metrics
4. Allocate corporate overhead (typically capitalized at 6-8x)
5. Deduct net debt and add non-operating assets

**Conglomerate discount** of **10-30%** often applied due to management complexity, poor capital allocation, and lack of pure-play transparency.

---

## Growth companies require specialized approaches

Companies with negative earnings or cash flows can't be valued using standard P/E or DCF methods. Specialized approaches focus on leading indicators of future profitability.

### Revenue multiples value top-line growth

When EBITDA is negative, revenue becomes the primary valuation anchor:
```
EV/Revenue = Enterprise Value / Total Revenue
```

**Growth-adjusted interpretation:** A company growing revenue at 40% deserves a higher revenue multiple than one growing at 10%. SaaS companies at 40%+ growth typically command **8-12x EV/ARR**.

### Rule of 40 balances growth and profitability

```
Rule of 40 Score = Revenue Growth Rate (%) + Profit Margin (%)
```

Companies scoring 40+ are considered healthy—they balance growth investment with operating efficiency. A company growing 50% with -10% margins scores 40 (acceptable). One growing 15% with 5% margins scores 20 (underperforming).

### SaaS metrics drive software valuations

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):**
```
ARR = Monthly Recurring Revenue × 12
```

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR):**
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churned - Contraction) / Starting MRR × 100
```

Top-quartile SaaS companies achieve **130%+ NRR**—they expand revenue from existing customers faster than they lose it.

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
CAC = Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired
LTV/CAC Ratio: Target ≥ 3:1
```

A healthy **LTV/CAC of 3:1** means $3 of value created for every $1 spent acquiring customers. Below 1:1 destroys value; above 5:1 may indicate underinvestment in growth.

**EV/ARR multiples by growth rate (2025 market):**
| Revenue Growth | Typical EV/ARR |
|----------------|----------------|
| <20% | 3-5x |
| 20-40% | 5-8x |
| 40-60% | 8-12x |
| 60%+ | 12-20x+ |

### User-based valuation for consumer platforms

```
Value per User = Enterprise Value / Active Users (DAU or MAU)
ARPU = Total Revenue / Active Users
```

**Metcalfe's Law** suggests network value grows proportional to **n²** (number of users squared)—explaining the massive valuations of platforms with strong network effects.

### Real options value growth optionality

Early-stage companies possess valuable options: to expand into new markets, delay investments, or abandon failing projects. These real options add value beyond DCF.

**Black-Scholes application:**
```
C = S₀ × N(d₁) - K × e^(-rT) × N(d₂)
```

**Variable mapping:**
- **S₀** = Present value of expected project cash flows
- **K** = Investment required to exercise the option
- **T** = Time until option expires
- **σ** = Volatility of project cash flows

Real options valuation is most applicable to **R&D-intensive companies, phased geographic expansion, and patent portfolios**. However, input estimation is challenging—use primarily as qualitative framework rather than precise calculation.

### DCF for negative cash flows extends the forecast

When cash flows are currently negative, extend the projection period until they turn positive:

1. Project **10-15 years** (vs. typical 5-year DCF)
2. Model detailed path to profitability: gross margin improvement, operating leverage
3. Include negative FCF years in the sum (they reduce value)
4. Apply **scenario analysis** with probability weights:
```
Expected Value = (Bull Case × 25%) + (Base Case × 50%) + (Bear Case × 25%)
```

---

## Discount rates translate future value to present value

The discount rate is the required return that makes an investment worthwhile—it reflects the time value of money plus risk.

### WACC weighs cost of debt and equity

```
WACC = (E/V) × re + (D/V) × rd × (1 - T)
```

**Variables:**
- **E** = Market value of equity (shares × price)
- **D** = Market value of debt (use book value for non-traded debt)
- **V** = E + D
- **re** = Cost of equity
- **rd** = Cost of debt (yield on company bonds)
- **T** = Marginal tax rate

**Typical WACC ranges:** Utilities **4-6%**; industrials **7-9%**; technology **8-12%**.

### CAPM calculates cost of equity

```
re = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf)
```

**Current inputs (December 2024/January 2025):**
- **Rf (Risk-free rate):** 10-Year Treasury ≈ **4.3-4.5%** (source: FRED)
- **ERP (Equity Risk Premium):** **4.3-5.5%** (Damodaran implied: 4.33%; Kroll recommended: 5.5%)
- **β (Beta):** Company-specific (source: Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg)

**Adjusted Beta (Bloomberg method):**
```
βadjusted = 0.67 × βraw + 0.33 × 1.0
```

**Unlevering/relevering beta (Hamada equation):**
```
βU = βL / [1 + (1 - T) × (D/E)]
βL = βU × [1 + (1 - T) × (D/E)]
```

Use unlevered beta to compare companies with different capital structures.

### Build-Up Method for private companies

```
re = Rf + ERP + Size Premium + Industry Premium + Company-Specific Premium
```

**Size premiums (Kroll 2025 data):**
| Market Cap | Size Premium |
|------------|--------------|
| >$50B | -0.4% |
| $3B-$5B | 1.2% |
| $600M-$1.2B | 2.0% |
| $150M-$300M | 3.2% |
| <$2M | ~11% |

**Company-specific factors (0-5%+):** Customer concentration, management depth, competitive position, regulatory exposure.

### Cost of debt uses credit spreads

**For traded bonds:** Use yield to maturity (YTM).

**Synthetic rating method (Damodaran):**
```
Cost of Debt = Risk-free Rate + Default Spread based on Interest Coverage Ratio
```

**Interest Coverage to Rating mapping:**
| Interest Coverage | Rating | Default Spread |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| >8.5 | AAA | 0.45% |
| 4.25-5.5 | A | 0.85% |
| 2.5-3.0 | BBB | 1.20% |
| 1.75-2.0 | B+ | 2.61% |
| <1.25 | CCC | 7.28% |

**After-tax cost of debt:**
```
After-tax rd = Pre-tax rd × (1 - T)
```

---

## Terminal value captures value beyond the forecast period

Terminal value typically represents **60-80%** of total DCF value, making its calculation critical.

### Gordon Growth perpetuity method

```
TV = FCFn × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
```

**Constraints:**
- **g** must be less than WACC (or value goes infinite)
- **g** should approximate long-term GDP growth: **2-3%** for developed markets
- **g** should not exceed the risk-free rate long-term

### Exit Multiple method

```
TV = EBITDAn × Exit Multiple
```

Select exit multiple based on current trading multiples of mature companies in the industry. Cross-check implied perpetual growth rate:
```
Implied g = (TV × WACC - FCF) / (FCF + TV)
```

If implied growth exceeds 4%, the exit multiple may be too aggressive.

### Sensitivity analysis is essential

Create tables varying both WACC (±1%) and terminal growth (±0.5%). A ±1% change in terminal growth can swing value by **15-25%**.

## Decision framework for selecting valuation methods

Match valuation approach to company characteristics:

**By profitability stage:**
| Situation | Primary Method | Secondary Method |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Profitable, dividend paying | DCF (FCFE), DDM | P/E, EV/EBITDA |
| Profitable, no dividends | DCF (FCFF, FCFE) | EV/EBITDA, P/E |
| Unprofitable, revenue growing | EV/Revenue, SaaS metrics | Scenario DCF |
| Pre-revenue | VC Method, Real Options | User-based valuation |
| Distressed | Liquidation Value | Asset-based NAV |

**By industry:**
| Industry | Primary Methods |
|----------|-----------------|
| Banks/Insurance | P/B, Residual Income, P/E |
| Utilities | DCF (stable growth), DDM |
| Technology/SaaS | EV/Revenue, EV/ARR, Rule of 40 |
| REITs | NAV, P/FFO, Cap Rate |
| Manufacturing | EV/EBITDA, DCF, Asset-based |
| Biotech | rNPV, Real Options, Pipeline valuation |
| Conglomerates | Sum-of-the-Parts |

**By purpose:**
- **M&A:** DCF, Precedent Transactions, SOTP
- **Public equity investing:** Comps, DCF, Relative valuation
- **Venture capital:** VC Method, Revenue multiples, User metrics
- **Restructuring:** Liquidation value, Asset-based

---

---

## Practical implementation checklist

1. **Determine company stage:** Profitable? Growing? Asset-heavy? This dictates method selection.

2. **Gather data:** Pull financials from 10-K, market data from Yahoo Finance, and comparable multiples from industry databases.

3. **Calculate discount rate:** Use CAPM for cost of equity, synthetic rating for cost of debt, combine into WACC.

4. **Project cash flows or select multiples:** For DCF, forecast 5-10 years with explicit assumptions. For relative valuation, select peer group carefully.

5. **Calculate terminal value:** Use both perpetuity growth and exit multiple methods, verify implied growth is reasonable.

6. **Triangulate:** Apply 2-3 methods, compare results, understand drivers of differences.

7. **Sensitivity test:** Vary key assumptions (WACC, growth, multiples) to establish valuation range rather than point estimate.

8. **Document assumptions:** Every input should have a source and rationale. This enables updating as conditions change.

The goal is not false precision but informed judgment. A range of $45-55 per share based on explicit, well-reasoned assumptions is far more valuable than a confident "$50 exactly" that collapses under scrutiny.


Update Fund Tracker notice
In the Fund Tracker part of the tool, it would be good if the user gets notified when there is an update of the Fund holdings. When you check the fund holdings and there are updates on the holdings can you indicate this in the navigation bar on the Fund Tracker link with a small symbol and in the Fund Tracker tab mark the Fund that has been updated.
This way the user can notice when there are updates on the holdings.

ETF Tracker
I would like to implement a ETF tracker that works in the same way as the Fund Tracker part. The main difference is that the data must be provided by a new agent that need to be implemented as well.
Thestructure f the ETF Tracker should be the same:
- List of all ETFs on the left with n item that summarises all at the top with holdings, Recent changes, New positions, Sold positions. The date the dta was extracted. An indication on recent changes just like in the Fund tracker.
The same possibilities to add new ETFs or delete them, just like in the Fund Tracker, but for ETFs.
Please make sure to analyse the structure and functionality of the Fund Tracker first so you know how to implement this in the same way.
The agent that provides the data will have the following requirements:
- The agent downloads the holdings from a website in csv or pdf format. The website will be provided. 
- Via the configuration tab it should be possible to change the ETF URL from where the data is collected.
- The agenmt must be able to open the URL and find the correct link to download the holdings from
- the preferred format is CSV
