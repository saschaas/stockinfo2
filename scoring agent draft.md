Below is a **practical, structured risk-assessment framework** you can apply when using technical indicators (MACD, RSI, S/R, trend, volume, volatility, etc.).
It is designed for your stock-research tool and works both for manual reviewing and automation.

# ✅ **A Complete Risk-Assessment Approach for Technical Stock Analysis**

The goal:
**Determine whether the current price offers a favorable and acceptable level of risk to enter a position.**

This means combining technical indicators, volatility, trend strength, proximity to support/resistance, and confirmation signals into one coherent evaluation.

Imprtant:
Multi-Timeframe Confirmation Filtering (MFTA Multiplier)
Reliable trading signals must be confirmed across different timeframes. The tool should use a rigorous Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MFTA) confirmation mechanism that modifies the final WTS score.   

The decision-making process includes an MFTA Alignment Rule: if the short-term entry signal aligns with the long-term primary trend context (e.g., bullish crossover on 60-minute confirmed by price above 200-EMA on the Daily chart), the TAA applies a positive WTS Multiplier (e.g., 1.2x) to amplify the final score. Conversely, if the execution signal contradicts the primary trend, a penalizing multiplier (e.g., 0.5x) is applied, actively dampening the signal’s confidence and generally preventing trades against the dominant direction. 

The framework below breaks this down into four layers.

---

# 1️⃣ **Layer 1 — Market Structure Risk (Support, Resistance, Trend)**

This is the most important layer: if the structure is bad, indicators don’t matter.

### **A. Distance to nearest support (downside risk)**

This tells you how far the price can drop before hitting a logical “floor.”

* *Far above support → high risk*
* *Near support → lower risk and better reward potential*

A good threshold:
**Risk is acceptable when price is <3–5% above strong support**
(for daily timeframe).

### **B. Distance to nearest resistance (upside potential)**

Gives you your potential reward.

* Resistance close → low reward
* Resistance far → high reward

You want:
**Reward ≥ 2× risk** (preferably 3×)

### **C. Trend direction and strength**

Use SMA/EMA 50–200, ADX, MACD zero line.

Rules of thumb:

* Uptrend + rising momentum → *risk lower*
* Trendless (ADX < 20) → *risk higher due to noise*
* Downtrend + weakening momentum → *risk high*

**Trend and structure should agree before taking a trade.**

# 2️⃣ **Layer 2 — Momentum & Indicator-Based Risk**

Consider indicators not as signals but as **risk flags**.

### **A. Momentum weakening**

* MACD histogram falling
* MACD close to bearish crossover
* RSI rolling over from >60
  This means **increasing risk** because the move may stall.

### **B. Overextended conditions**

* RSI > 70 (daily)
* Price above upper Bollinger Band
* Fast EMA far above slow EMA

This indicates:
**Price may correct**, so opening now carries elevated risk.

### **C. Bullish or bearish divergence**

Divergence is a major risk indicator.

* **Bearish divergence** in an uptrend → *trend risk increasing*
* **Bullish divergence** in a downtrend → *short risk increasing*

Divergence warns that price may soon reverse.

# 3️⃣ **Layer 3 — Volatility & Position-Sizing Risk**

### **A. ATR-based volatility risk**

ATR tells you how much a stock typically fluctuates.

If ATR is high, your stop must be wider.
If your stop is wider, **position size must be smaller**.

Formula for stop:

> **Stop distance = 1.5–2 × ATR(14)**

Formula for position size (based on portfolio risk):

> **Position size = (portfolio risk amount) ÷ (stop distance × share price)**

High ATR → higher baseline risk.

### **B. Avoid trades with poor risk/reward**

You should only enter if:

> **Reward / Risk ≥ 1.8**
> preferably **≥ 2.0–3.0**

Otherwise even a “bullish setup” is actually a **bad investment**.

---

# 4️⃣ **Layer 4 — Volume & Confirmation Risk**

### **A. Volume confirmation reduces risk**

If a breakout (or breakdown) happens:

* Volume spike → confirmation → **lower risk**
* Low volume → fragile move → **higher risk**

### **B. Volume near support**

If price bounces from support on high volume:
→ support is strong → **risk lower**

If it bounces on low volume:
→ support may fail soon → **risk higher**

---

# 🧮 **Putting It All Together: “Risk Score” System**

You can combine all layers into a single score.

### **Example structure:**

| Category            | Weight | Scoring Example                           | Interpretation     |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Market Structure    | 40%    | Near support (+), far from resistance (+) | Highest impact     |
| Momentum Health     | 20%    | MACD rising (+), RSI neutral (+)          | Confirms structure |
| Overextension       | −15%   | RSI > 70 (–), BB breakout (–)             | Adds caution       |
| Volatility          | −15%   | ATR high (–), small stop impossible (–)   | Affects size       |
| Volume Confirmation | 20%    | Breakout on high volume (+)               | Validates move     |

Total → **Risk Score from 0 (high risk) to 100 (low risk)**

Then:

### **Interpretation**

* **80–100 → Low risk** (good entry zone if reward ≥ risk×2)
* **60–80 → Medium risk** (reasonable entry, but confirm trend)
* **40–60 → Elevated risk** (wait for better structure)
* **<40 → High risk** (avoid)

This system removes emotion and forces a rational decision.

# 🎯 Final Decision Logic (Simple & Effective)

If the following conditions are all true, risk is low:

1. **Price is near strong support**
2. **Resistance is far enough to give good reward**
3. **Momentum is improving** (MACD histogram rising, RSI rising)
4. **Trend aligns** (higher timeframe bullish or stabilizing)
5. **ATR allows a reasonable stop distance**
6. **Volume confirms the move**

If **any of these fails**, risk increases.

If **several** fail → strong “wait” or “avoid.”

# 🧠 Summary: A Good Technical Risk Assessment Should Combine

✔ Structural risk (support/resistance & trend)
✔ Indicator risk (momentum, divergence, overbought/oversold)
✔ Volatility risk (ATR + position sizing)
✔ Confirmation risk (volume behavior)
